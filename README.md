# **Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots**

## **Hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway**

This repository contains my ongoing work for the **Capstone Project of Summer Analytics 2025**. The objective is to build a real-time, intelligent pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using data-driven strategies and core Python tools (NumPy, Pandas, and Pathway).
The goal is to simulate smart, dynamic pricing that reflects demand, congestion, vehicle type, and nearby competitionâ€”helping optimize urban parking space allocation.

### **ðŸ“Œ Current Focus**
Iâ€™m currently:
- Exploring the dataset and engineering relevant features
- Designing a simple linear pricing model as a baseline
